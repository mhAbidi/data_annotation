Data Annotation Software:

This software is as is and to be used at users risk.
In case of data corruption; the user is responsible.

This script is for the annotation of straight horizontal lines over images.
Enter  the  path  where  images  are  stored.
You will then be showed images in a new window.
Simply click where you want the annotation line.
If you click somewhere by mistake; simply ignore it and click at the correct spot.
If you close the image without clicking; 0,0,width,0 is annoted.
After the position is satisfactory, press any key to move to the next image.

Directly close the shell to stop execution.

The script will continue where you left off.


Cheers!



Press Enter to start.
